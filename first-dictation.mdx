## Before You Begin

Make sure you've completed these steps:

- ✓ [Installed Stenox](/installation) and granted permissions
- ✓ [Configured a transcription provider](/first-dictation#step-2-configure-a-transcription-provider)

<Note>
  If you haven't set up a provider yet, we recommend starting with [WhisperKit (local)](/transcription/whisperkit-local) for the easiest setup.
</Note>

## The Recording Process

Stenox supports two recording modes. This guide uses **Push-to-Talk** (the default):

1. **Activate** - Press and hold your hotkey
2. **Record** - Speak your message while holding
3. **Process** - Release the hotkey to stop recording
4. **Insert** - Text appears at your cursor

<Note>
  **Toggle mode** is also available in Settings. With toggle mode, you press once to start recording and press again to stop—no need to hold the key.
</Note>

Let's walk through it step by step.

## Step-by-Step: Your First Dictation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an application with a text field">
    Start with a simple app like **Notes** or **TextEdit**:

    1. Open the app from Spotlight (Cmd+Space, type "Notes")
    2. Create a new note or document
    3. Click in the text area to position your cursor
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check the Stenox menu bar icon">
    Look for the Stenox icon in your menu bar (top right of your screen).

    **Icon colors:**
    - **Gray** - Idle, ready to record
    - **Red** - Recording in progress
    - **Spinning** - Processing your audio

    Make sure it's gray (idle) before starting.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Press and hold Option+Space">
    This is the default hotkey. Hold both keys down simultaneously.

    **What you'll see:**
    - Menu bar icon turns **red**
    - Recording overlay appears on screen
    - Audio waveform shows your voice input

    <Tip>
      The recording only happens while you're holding the keys. Release early and Stenox will process whatever you've said so far.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Speak your message clearly">
    While holding the hotkey, speak naturally into your microphone.

    **Try saying:**
    > "Hello, this is my first voice dictation with Stenox. It's faster than typing!"

    **Tips:**
    - Speak at a normal conversational pace
    - Don't over-enunciate or speak too slowly
    - Stay about 6-12 inches from your microphone
    - Watch the waveform to confirm audio is being captured
  </Step>

  <Step title="Release the hotkey when done">
    Let go of Option+Space when you finish speaking.

    **What happens next:**
    - Recording overlay disappears
    - Icon shows processing (spinning or animated)
    - Stenox transcribes your audio (1-3 seconds typically)
    - Text appears at your cursor position
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the transcribed text">
    Your spoken words should now appear as text!

    Check the accuracy:
    - Are the words correct?
    - Is punctuation appropriate?
    - Is capitalization correct?

    <Note>
      First-time accuracy depends on your provider, microphone quality, and speaking clarity. It improves with practice!
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Try It Again

Practice makes perfect! Try a few more dictations:

### Practice Dictations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Practice 1: A simple sentence">
    **Say:** "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

    This tests basic transcription accuracy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Practice 2: With punctuation">
    **Say:** "Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you! This is amazing."

    Notice how the provider adds punctuation automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Practice 3: Longer paragraph">
    **Say:** "Stenox helps me work faster by converting my voice to text. I can dictate emails, messages, and documents without touching the keyboard. It's especially useful for long-form writing."

    Test how well it handles longer content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Practice 4: Technical terms">
    **Say:** "Stenox uses WhisperKit for local transcription and supports cloud providers like DeepGram and AssemblyAI."

    Test capitalization and technical terminology.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Visual Feedback

Learn to read Stenox's indicators:

### Menu Bar Icon States

| Icon State | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| Gray (idle) | Ready to record |
| Red (solid) | Recording your voice |
| Spinning/animated | Processing transcription |
| Blue pulse | Text insertion in progress |

### Recording Overlay

The floating overlay shows:
- **Waveform** - Visual representation of your voice input
- **Timer** - Recording duration
- **Model/Provider** - Currently active transcription provider

<Tip>
  If you don't see the overlay, check Stenox Settings → **Settings** tab → ensure "Show recording overlay" is enabled.
</Tip>

## Common First-Time Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No text appears after speaking" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Microphone not working (check System Settings → Sound → Input)
    - No provider configured (go to Settings → Models)
    - Accessibility permission not granted (go to Settings → check permissions)

    **Solution:** Verify permissions and provider configuration in Stenox Settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transcription is inaccurate" icon="spell-check">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Background noise
    - Poor microphone quality
    - Speaking too fast or unclear
    - Wrong language selected

    **Solution:** Try speaking more clearly in a quiet environment. Consider using a headset microphone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recording starts but immediately stops" icon="stop">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Not holding hotkey long enough
    - Hotkey conflict with another app
    - Audio input device not selected

    **Solution:** Hold the hotkey for the entire duration of speaking. Check Settings → **Audio** tab for input device.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hotkey doesn't work" icon="keyboard">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Another app is using the same hotkey
    - Accessibility permission not granted
    - Stenox not running in background

    **Solution:** Change the hotkey in Settings or check for conflicting apps. Ensure Stenox icon appears in menu bar.
