## What are System Prompts?

System prompts tell the AI enhancement provider how to process your transcribed text. They control grammar correction, formatting, tone, and structure.

<Tip>
  Each profile can have its own system prompt — use professional tone for work emails and casual tone for personal notes.
</Tip>

## Default Enhancement

Both Stenox Cloud and local providers come with fine-tuned enhancements that we continue to refine. No configuration needed — Stenox works great out of the box.

<Note>
  Custom prompts are optional for general use. However, **profiles with custom prompts** are powerful for users who want specific behavior per app — like professional tone in email clients or technical formatting in code editors.

## Provider Differences

Different AI providers interpret prompts differently:

| Provider | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **OpenAI GPT-4o** | Follows complex instructions well, nuanced |
| **Google Gemini** | Good at formatting, fast responses |
| **Groq LLMs** | Fast, good for simpler prompts |
| **MLX (Local)** | Works best with simple, direct prompts |

<Note>
  **For local MLX models:** Keep prompts simple and direct. Complex multi-step instructions may not work as well as with larger cloud models.
</Note>

## Testing Your Prompts

After changing a prompt:

1. **Test with typical input** — Dictate something you'd normally say
2. **Check the output** — Does it match your expectations?
3. **Iterate** — Refine the prompt until it works consistently
4. **Edge cases** — Test with unusual input to catch issues

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI changes too much" icon="pen-nib">
    Add constraints:
    ```
    Fix only grammar errors.
    Keep my exact wording when possible.
    Make minimal changes.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI doesn't change enough" icon="circle-xmark">
    Be more directive:
    ```
    Actively improve sentence structure.
    Fix all errors including style issues.
    Polish the text for professional use.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong formatting" icon="align-left">
    Be explicit about format:
    ```
    Output as a single paragraph with no bullet points.
    ```
    Or:
    ```
    Format as bullet points, one idea per line.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prompt works with one provider but not another" icon="shuffle">
    Different models have different capabilities. Simplify prompts for local MLX models, or create separate profiles for different providers.
  </Accordion>
