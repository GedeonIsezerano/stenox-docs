## What are Profiles?

Stenox works great out of the box. It transcribes your speech, cleans up filler words, and formats your text beautifully.

**Profiles let you go the extra mile.**

When you want more control over how your text is formatted in specific apps, profiles give you that precision. Each profile can have:

- Custom formatting instructions
- Auto-activation rules for specific apps
- Different provider configurations

  **Profiles are optional.** Stenox's default behavior handles most use cases well. Profiles exist for when you want that extra bit of control.

## What Can Profiles Do?

Profiles shine when you want app-specific formatting that goes beyond basic cleanup.

### Add Structure to Your Output

- **Email signatures** — Automatically append your sign-off
- **Greetings** — Start emails with "Hi [name]," or your preferred opener
- **Formatting preferences** — Bullet points for notes, paragraphs for emails

### Match the Context

- **Formal tone** for client communications
- **Casual tone** for team chat
- **Technical formatting** for documentation

### Automate the Repetitive

Instead of manually adding "Best regards, [Your name]" to every email, let your email profile handle it. Speak naturally, and Stenox formats the output exactly how you want it.

## How Profiles Work

### Default Behavior

Without any custom profiles, Stenox uses your default settings everywhere. This works well for most people.

### With Profiles

1. **Create a profile** for a specific app or use case
2. **Set activation rules** (which apps trigger this profile)
3. **Define your formatting** instructions
4. **Use Stenox normally** — profiles activate automatically

---

## Switching Profiles

### Automatic (Recommended)

Profiles activate based on:
- **Active application** — Profile triggers when you're in a specific app
- **Window title** — Profile triggers based on what's in the window title

This means you never have to think about it. Open Gmail, and your email profile kicks in. Switch to Slack, and your chat profile takes over.

### Manual

If you prefer manual control:

1. Click Stenox menu bar icon
2. Hover over "Profiles"
3. Select the profile you want

## Profile Management

### Editing & Deleting

- **Settings → Profiles tab** to manage all profiles
- Select any profile to edit its settings
- Delete profiles you no longer need (except the Default profile)

### Color Coding

Assign colors to profiles for quick visual identification in the menu bar.
