| 10 seconds | 1-2 seconds |
| 30 seconds | 2-3 seconds |

<Note>
  AssemblyAI is optimized for streaming, so longer recordings don't significantly increase processing time.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    - Try a shorter test recording first
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Poor accuracy for your accent" icon="microphone-slash">
    - AssemblyAI is generally excellent with accents, but try:
      - Speaking slightly more clearly
      - Reducing background noise
      - Using a better microphone
      - Adding custom vocabulary in Stenox
    - Compare with DeepGram or WhisperKit for your specific accent
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong language detected (auto-detect)" icon="globe">
    - Instead of auto-detect, manually select your language in Stenox profile settings
    - Speak longer phrases (auto-detect needs more context)
