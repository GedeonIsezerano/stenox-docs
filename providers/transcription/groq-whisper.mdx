## Features

### LPU-Accelerated Processing

Groq's Language Processing Units (LPUs) deliver exceptional speed:

- **Near-instant results** - Sub-second for most recordings
- **Consistent performance** - No variability in processing time
- **Scalable** - Same speed regardless of usage volume

### File-Based Transcription

Groq uses file-based transcription (not streaming):

- Audio recorded completely, then sent
- Processed as a single file
- Results returned all at once
- Slightly different from streaming providers (DeepGram, AssemblyAI)

**What this means:**
- You get the complete transcript at once (no partial results)
- Slightly higher latency than streaming (~1-2 seconds)
- Still very fast overall

### Automatic Punctuation

Whisper models include automatic punctuation:

- Periods, commas, question marks, exclamation points
- Capitalization of proper nouns
- Natural sentence formatting

## Performance

**Expected processing times with Groq Whisper:**

| Recording Length | Processing Time |
|------------------|-----------------|
| 5 seconds | < 1 second |
| 10 seconds | 1-2 seconds |
| 30 seconds | 2-3 seconds |
| 60 seconds | 3-4 seconds |

<Note>
  Groq's LPU architecture makes it one of the fastest cloud transcription options available.
</Note>

## Usage Tracking

Monitor your Groq usage in the console:

1. Visit [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Go to **Usage** or **Billing** section

## Privacy Considerations

- Audio and transcripts may be logged for service improvement
- Data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS)

- Or review Groq's privacy policy for details
