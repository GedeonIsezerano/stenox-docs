- Optimized with CoreML and ANE (Apple Neural Engine)

### Intel Macs

**Slower performance:**

- CPU-only processing
- Consider cloud providers for faster results

<Tip>
  WhisperKit works best on Apple Silicon Macs. Intel Mac users may prefer cloud providers for faster transcription.
</Tip>

- **Location:** `~/stenox-models/whisper/`
- **base.en / base:** ~142 MB
- **small.en / small:** ~483 MB
- **medium:** ~1.5 GB (if you download it manually)

You can delete models you're not using to free up space.

## When to Use Cloud Instead

Consider cloud providers if you need:

- **Faster processing** - Cloud is 5-10x faster (< 1 second vs 3-5 seconds)
- **Higher accuracy** - DeepGram Nova-3 and AssemblyAI often outperform Whisper
- **Intel Mac** - Cloud providers work equally well on all Macs

<Note>
  You can use **both** WhisperKit and cloud providers! Create different [Profiles](/profiles/creating-profiles) for different scenarios.
