## The Stenox Pipeline

Your voice goes through two stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Transcription">
    Speech → Text (WhisperKit, DeepGram, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Enhancement">
    Raw text → Polished output (MLX, Gemini, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Each stage is **independent** — mix local and cloud providers however you like. Use WhisperKit (local) for transcription and Gemini (cloud) for enhancement, or go fully local with WhisperKit + MLX.
</Tip>

## Skip AI Enhancement

Don't need grammar correction? Set AI Enhancement to **None** in your profile settings. This:

- Reduces processing time by 1-3 seconds
- Inserts raw transcription directly
- Still applies vocabulary replacements

<Note>
  Raw transcription is great for quick notes or when you'll edit the text anyway.
</Note>
