### Apple Silicon Macs

**Excellent performance:**
- Qwen 1.5B: 2-3 seconds per paragraph
- Gemma 2B: 3-4 seconds per paragraph
- Phi-3 3.8B: 5-7 seconds per paragraph

**Optimized with:**
- Metal GPU acceleration
- Apple Neural Engine (ANE)
- Unified memory architecture

### Intel Macs

**Not supported:**
- MLX requires Apple Silicon
- Intel Mac users should use cloud providers ([Gemini](/providers/llm/google-gemini) or [Groq](/providers/llm/groq-llms))

<Warning>
  MLX models only work on Apple Silicon Macs. Intel Mac users must use cloud enhancement providers.
</Warning>

## Apple Silicon Required

MLX models require Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4). Intel Mac users should use cloud providers like [Gemini](/providers/llm/google-gemini) or [Groq](/providers/llm/groq-llms).

## What MLX Enhancement Does

### Grammar Correction

- Fixes grammatical errors
- Subject-verb agreement
- Tense corrections
- Article usage (a, an, the)

**Example:**
- **Before:** "me and sarah was going to store"
- **After:** "Sarah and I were going to the store."

### Capitalization

- Sentence beginnings
- Proper nouns (names, places)
- Acronyms and abbreviations

**Example:**
- **Before:** "john lives in new york city and works for ibm"
- **After:** "John lives in New York City and works for IBM."

### Punctuation

- Adds missing commas, periods
- Fixes run-on sentences
- Improves readability

**Example:**
- **Before:** "hello how are you doing today its nice to meet you"
- **After:** "Hello, how are you doing today? It's nice to meet you."

### Light Formatting

- Number formatting (spelled out → digits)
- Date and time formatting
- Basic list formatting

<Note>
  MLX models provide **basic to good** enhancement. For maximum quality, consider cloud providers like [Google Gemini](/providers/llm/google-gemini).

## When to Use MLX

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Privacy is critical" icon="lock">
    Healthcare, legal, financial, or sensitive content.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Working offline" icon="wifi-slash">
    Airplanes, remote locations, or unreliable internet.
  </Card>

  <Card title="No API costs" icon="dollar-sign">
    No per-use charges. Processing happens on your Mac.
  </Card>

  <Card title="100% local setup" icon="computer">
    Combine with WhisperKit for completely offline dictation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to Use Cloud Instead

Consider cloud providers if you need:

- **Faster processing** - Cloud is 2-3x faster (< 1 second vs 2-5 seconds)
- **Better quality** - Gemini 2.5 Flash and Groq LLMs often outperform small MLX models
- **Intel Mac** - MLX requires Apple Silicon
- **Complex edits** - Tone adjustment, style changes, formatting

<Tip>
  Use **both**! Create different [Profiles](/profiles/creating-profiles):
  - MLX for personal notes (privacy)
  - Gemini for work emails (quality)
  - Auto-switch based on application
</Tip>

## Custom Prompts

Configure how MLX enhances your text in Profile settings:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default">
    ```
    Fix grammar and punctuation errors.
    Keep the original meaning and tone.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Professional">
    ```
    Fix grammar and rewrite in a professional tone.
    Suitable for business emails.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Minimal">
    ```
    Only fix obvious grammar errors.
    Change as little as possible.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="Model download fails" icon="cloud-arrow-down">
    - Check internet connection
    - Ensure sufficient disk space (~2-4 GB per model)
    - Try downloading again
    - Check `~/stenox-models/mlx/` for partial downloads and delete them
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enhancement is very slow (> 10 seconds)" icon="hourglass">
    - Try a smaller model (Qwen 2.5 1.5B or Gemma 3n 2B instead of larger models)
    - Close other intensive applications
    - Check Activity Monitor for available RAM
    - Your Mac may not have enough RAM for larger models
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MLX option not available / grayed out" icon="ban">
    - You're on an Intel Mac (MLX requires Apple Silicon)
    - Use [Google Gemini](/providers/llm/google-gemini) or [Groq LLMs](/providers/llm/groq-llms) instead
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enhancement quality is poor" icon="spell-check">
    - Try Gemma 3n 2B (best accuracy) or a larger model
    - Adjust custom prompt in Profile settings
    - For maximum quality, use cloud providers ([Gemini](/providers/llm/google-gemini))
    - Add specific formatting instructions to your custom prompt
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App crashes or runs out of memory" icon="memory">
    - Your model is too large for available RAM
    - Use Qwen 2.5 1.5B or Gemma 3n 2B on 8GB Macs
    - Upgrade to 16GB+ RAM for larger models
    - Close other applications to free memory
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
