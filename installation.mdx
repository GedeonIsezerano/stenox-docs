## Required Permissions

Stenox requires two system permissions to function properly.

### Microphone Access

Stenox needs microphone access to capture your voice.

**You'll be prompted automatically on first launch:**
1. Click **OK** when the microphone permission dialog appears
2. If you accidentally deny access, go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone**
3. Enable the toggle next to Stenox

### Accessibility Access

Stenox uses Accessibility API to insert text at your cursor position.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open System Settings">
    The Stenox onboarding wizard will guide you to System Settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Accessibility">
    Go to **Privacy & Security → Accessibility** in System Settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the lock to make changes">
    Click the lock icon at the bottom left and authenticate with Touch ID or password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Stenox">
    Find Stenox in the list and toggle it on. If Stenox isn't listed, click the **+** button to add it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to Stenox">
    Go back to Stenox and continue through the onboarding wizard.
  </Step>

<Warning>
  Without Accessibility permission, Stenox cannot insert text into other applications. This permission is essential for core functionality.
</Warning>

After granting permissions, you'll complete the onboarding wizard:

1. **Welcome Screen** - Overview of Stenox features

  **Contacting support is easy!** If the issue isn't with recording itself, go to **Settings → About → Send Feedback**. Simply record your feedback with your voice, and it will be transcribed and sent to us automatically. You can also use the feedback hotkey (**Right ⌘ + Right ⌥**) from anywhere.
