## Complete Privacy with Local Processing

Stenox can operate completely offline using local models for both transcription and AI enhancement. This means your audio and text never leave your Mac - perfect for sensitive content, confidential work, or privacy-conscious users.

<Tip>
  **100% Private = WhisperKit (transcription) + MLX (AI enhancement)**

  No internet connection required, no API keys, no cloud services, complete privacy.
</Tip>

Follow these steps to configure Stenox for completely private operation.

### Step 1: Configure WhisperKit (Local Transcription)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Stenox Settings">
    Click the Stenox menu bar icon → **Settings**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Models tab">

## Performance Expectations

### Processing Time

With local processing, expect these speeds:

|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **WhisperKit base.en only** | ~3-5 seconds | 3-5s transcription |
| **WhisperKit + MLX Qwen 1.5B** | ~5-7 seconds | 3-4s transcription + 2-3s enhancement |

  Local processing is slower than cloud (which can be ~1-2 seconds total), but provides complete privacy.
</Note>

### Apple Silicon Note

<Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Models won't download" icon="cloud-arrow-down">
    - Models require internet to download (one-time)
    - After download, they work offline forever

      3. Upgrade to Apple Silicon Mac
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Out of disk space" icon="hard-drive">

## Hybrid Approach (Alternative)

If you want privacy for audio but cloud quality for text:

**Setup:**
- **Transcription:** WhisperKit (local) - Audio stays private
- **Enhancement:** Google Gemini or Groq (cloud) - Text enhanced in cloud

**Benefits:**
- Most sensitive data (audio) stays local
- High-quality enhancement via cloud
- Faster than full local (4-5s vs 7-10s)

## Cloud API Keys & Privacy Policies

When using cloud providers, Stenox supports bring-your-own-API-keys. This means **your data privacy is governed by your API provider's policies**, not Stenox.
