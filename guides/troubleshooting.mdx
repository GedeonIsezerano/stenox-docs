## Common Issues

This guide covers the most common issues users encounter and how to solve them.

<Tip>
  **Quick fix for most issues:** Restart Stenox. Click menu bar icon → Quit Stenox → Relaunch from Applications.
</Tip>

## No Text Appears After Dictation

### Symptoms
- You speak and release the hotkey
- Stenox processes (icon spins or shows activity)
- But no text appears in your application

### Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Grant Accessibility permission" icon="universal-access">
    **Most common cause**

    1. Open **System Settings**
    2. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
    3. Ensure **Stenox** is in the list and toggled ON
    4. If not listed, click **+** and add Stenox from Applications folder
    5. Restart Stenox

    [See Installation guide →](/installation)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Click in a text field first" icon="cursor">
    - Stenox inserts text where your cursor is
    - Click in the text field/app before dictating
    - Ensure the application is active (not in background)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Some fields are protected" icon="lock">
    macOS protects certain fields from text insertion:
    - Password fields
    - Secure input fields
    - Some system dialogs

    **Workaround:** Stenox will copy text to clipboard if direct insertion fails. Paste with Cmd+V.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check transcription provider" icon="microphone">
    - Verify provider is configured (Settings → Transcription tab)
    - Check API key is valid (for cloud providers)
    - Test with WhisperKit (local) to isolate issue
