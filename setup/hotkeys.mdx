## Default Hotkeys

Stenox comes with four configurable hotkeys for different actions:

| Action | Default Hotkey | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Hold-to-Record** | `fn` (Globe key) | Hold to record, release to process |
| **Toggle Recording** | `Option + Space` | Press to start, press again to stop |
| **Cancel Recording** | `Escape` | Cancel the current recording |
| **Feedback** | `Right ⌘ + Right ⌥` | Send feedback directly to the team |

<Note>
  All hotkeys can be customized in **Settings → Hotkeys**.
</Note>

## Recording Modes

Stenox supports two recording modes:

### Push-to-Talk (Default)

Hold the hotkey while speaking, release when done.

**How it works:**
1. Press and **hold** the hotkey (default: `fn`)
2. Speak your message while holding
3. **Release** the hotkey to stop recording
4. Stenox processes and inserts the text

**Best for:**
- Quick dictations
- Precise control over recording duration
- Preventing accidental recordings

### Toggle Mode

Press once to start recording, press again to stop.

**How it works:**
1. **Press** the hotkey once to start recording
2. Speak your message (hands-free)
3. **Press** the hotkey again to stop
4. Stenox processes and inserts the text

**Best for:**
- Longer dictations
- Hands-free operation
- When you can't hold a key continuously

<Tip>
  Enable Toggle Mode in **Settings → Hotkeys** by toggling "Toggle Mode" on.
</Tip>

## Hotkey Details

### Hold-to-Record Hotkey

The primary hotkey for starting recordings.

**Default:** `fn` (Globe key on Apple keyboards)

**Behavior:**
- **Push-to-Talk mode:** Hold to record, release to process
- **Toggle mode:** Press to start/stop recording

**Customization options:**
- Single modifier key (fn, Control, Option, Command)
- Modifier + key combination (e.g., `Control + R`)

<Warning>
  The `fn` key only works on Apple keyboards. If you're using a non-Apple keyboard, configure a different hotkey in Settings.
</Warning>

### Toggle Recording Hotkey

An alternative hotkey that always uses toggle behavior.

**Default:** `Option + Space`

**Behavior:**
- Press once to start recording
- Press again to stop recording
- Works regardless of your main recording mode setting

**Use case:** Quick toggle access even when Push-to-Talk is your primary mode.

### Cancel Recording Hotkey

Immediately cancel the current recording without processing.

**Default:** `Escape`

**Behavior:**
- Stops recording immediately
- Discards the audio (no transcription)
- Returns to idle state

**Use case:** Made a mistake or changed your mind mid-recording.

### Feedback Hotkey

Send feedback directly to the Stenox team using voice.

**Default:** `Right ⌘ + Right ⌥` (Right Command + Right Option)

**Behavior:**
- Opens the feedback interface
- Record your feedback with voice

<Tip>
  Use the feedback hotkey to report bugs, suggest features, or share your experience. Your voice feedback is transcribed and sent directly to the team.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hotkey doesn't work" icon="keyboard">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Another app is using the same hotkey
    - Accessibility permission not granted
    - Stenox not running in background
    - Using fn with a non-Apple keyboard

    **Solutions:**
    - Try a different hotkey combination
    - Check **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** for Stenox
    - Ensure Stenox icon appears in menu bar
    - Use `Option + Space` instead of `fn` for non-Apple keyboards
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="fn key not detected" icon="globe">
    The `fn` (Globe) key is specific to Apple keyboards and may not work with:
    - Third-party keyboards
    - Some external Apple keyboards
    - Keyboards with fn mapped to other functions

    **Solution:** Use `Option + Space` or another key combination instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hotkey works in some apps but not others" icon="window">
    Some apps capture hotkeys before Stenox can receive them.

    **Solutions:**
    - Try a different hotkey combination
    - Check the app's keyboard shortcuts settings
    - Use a more unique combination (e.g., `Control + Shift + R`)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cancel hotkey doesn't work" icon="xmark">
    Ensure you're pressing the cancel hotkey **during** an active recording.

    **Note:** The cancel hotkey only works while recording is in progress. If you're in idle state, there's nothing to cancel.
  </Accordion>
