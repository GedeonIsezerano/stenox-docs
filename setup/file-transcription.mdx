## Transcribe Files

Stenox can transcribe audio and video files — not just live dictation. Perfect for meetings, interviews, podcasts, or any recorded content.

<Tip>
  File transcription uses your configured transcription provider. For best results with long files, use a cloud provider like DeepGram or Groq.

## Provider Considerations

### For Short Files (< 5 minutes)

Any provider works well:
- **WhisperKit** — Local, private
- **Groq Whisper** — Fast, free tier
- **DeepGram** — Accurate

### For Long Files (> 5 minutes)

Cloud providers recommended:
- **DeepGram** — Best for long-form content
- **Groq Whisper** — Fast processing
- **AssemblyAI** — Good for meetings

<Warning>
  WhisperKit can handle long files but processing time increases significantly. For a 30-minute file, expect 10-15 minutes of processing time locally.
</Warning>

## Tips for Best Results

### Audio Quality

- Use the highest quality recording available
- Clear audio with minimal background noise transcribes best
- Multiple speakers work best with DeepGram or AssemblyAI

### File Size

- Smaller file sizes upload and process faster
- Consider compressing large files before transcription
- MP3 is a good balance of quality and size

### Language

- Set the correct language in your Profile settings
- Use multilingual models for non-English content
- Auto-detect works but explicit setting is more accurate

## AI Enhancement

File transcriptions can be enhanced just like live dictation:

- **Grammar correction** — Fix spoken language patterns
- **Punctuation** — Add proper punctuation
- **Formatting** — Clean up for readability

<Tip>
  For meeting transcripts, use a custom prompt like: "Format as meeting notes with bullet points for action items."
</Tip>

## Usage Limits

File transcription counts against your plan limits:

| Plan | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Free | 5 minutes/day total (including files) |
| Plus | Unlimited |
| Lifetime | Unlimited (with BYOK) |
| Lifetime Plus | Unlimited |

<Note>
  Using BYOK providers bypasses Stenox limits. Only your provider's limits apply.
</Note>
