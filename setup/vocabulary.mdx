## What is Vocabulary?

Vocabulary allows you to define custom word replacements that Stenox applies after transcription. This is perfect for:

- Technical terms
- Proper names (people, companies, products)
- Acronyms and abbreviations
- Domain-specific jargon
- Common corrections

## How It Works

**Process:**
1. You dictate and audio is transcribed
2. Stenox checks vocabulary list
3. Matches are replaced with your custom text
4. Result is enhanced (if AI enhancement enabled)
5. Final text is inserted

**Example:**
- You say: "stenox"
- Transcribed as: "stenox" (lowercase)
- Vocabulary replaces: "Stenox" (capitalized)
- Result: "Stenox"

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use lowercase for 'From' field" icon="a">
    Most transcription providers return lowercase text. Match this in your "From" field.

    **Good:** "stenox" → "Stenox"
    **Bad:** "Stenox" → "Stenox" (won't match lowercase input)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include spaces for multi-word phrases" icon="space">
    For multi-word replacements, include spaces.

    **Example:** "new york city" → "New York City"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be specific" icon="crosshairs">
    Specific phrases are less likely to cause unwanted replacements.

    **Good:** "dr smith" → "Dr. Smith"
    **Risky:** "dr" → "Doctor" (might replace "dr" in other contexts)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test your entries" icon="vial">
    After adding, test with dictation to ensure it works as expected.
  </Accordion>

## Limitations

**What vocabulary CAN'T do:**
- Change pronunciation recognition (happens during transcription)
- Fix poor audio quality
- Replace phrases transcribed incorrectly

**Solution:** For consistent misrecognition, try:
- Better microphone
- Speak more clearly
- Upgrade transcription model
