## Feedback Made Easy

Stenox makes it easy to send us feedback — just use your voice! Your message is transcribed and sent to our team automatically.

<Tip>
  **It's like dictating an email to us.** Just speak naturally, describe your issue or suggestion, and we'll receive it as a clear written message.
</Tip>

## How to Send Feedback

### Method 1: Settings Menu

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click the Stenox menu bar icon → **Settings**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to About">
    Select the **About** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Send Feedback">
    Click the **Send Feedback** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Speak Your Feedback">
    A recording dialog appears — speak naturally about your issue or suggestion
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit">
    When done, your message is transcribed and sent to our support team
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut

Use the feedback hotkey from anywhere:

**Right ⌘ + Right ⌥** (Right Command + Right Option)

This opens the feedback recorder instantly — no need to navigate through settings.

<Note>
  The feedback hotkey uses the **right-side** modifier keys. If you have a compact keyboard without right-side modifiers, use the Settings menu method instead.
</Note>

## What to Include

When sending feedback, it helps to mention:

### For Bug Reports

- **What happened** — Describe the issue
- **What you expected** — What should have happened
- **Steps to reproduce** — How can we recreate it?
- **Provider you're using** — WhisperKit, DeepGram, etc.

**Example:**
> "I'm using DeepGram for transcription, and sometimes after a long dictation the text doesn't appear. I expected it to insert at my cursor but nothing happens. This happens about once every ten dictations."

### For Feature Requests

- **What you want** — Describe the feature
- **Why it would help** — Your use case
- **How you imagine it working** — Optional details

**Example:**
> "I'd love to have a way to dictate directly into a specific application even when it's not focused. I often want to add notes while reading something else."

### For General Feedback

Just speak naturally! Tell us what you like, what could be better, or any thoughts you have.
