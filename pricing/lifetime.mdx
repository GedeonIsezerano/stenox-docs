## Compare Lifetime Options

## Lifetime

The standard Lifetime license is perfect if you:

- Already have API keys from DeepGram, OpenAI, Gemini, or Groq
- Want to use local providers (WhisperKit + MLX) exclusively
- Prefer to manage your own cloud provider accounts

<Note>
  **BYOK is powerful.** With your own API keys, you get direct access to providers, full control over your accounts, and often better pricing.
</Note>

### What You Get

- **Unlimited dictation** — No daily limits
- **$5 Stenox Cloud credit** — Try Stenox Cloud included
- **All features** — Profiles, vocabulary, file transcription
- **Local providers** — WhisperKit and MLX included
- **BYOK cloud** — Use any supported cloud provider with your keys
- **Future updates** — All app updates included

<Tip>
  Your $5 Stenox Cloud credit lets you try our fine-tuned cloud service. If you love it, upgrade to Lifetime Plus for unlimited Stenox Cloud access.
</Tip>

## Lifetime Plus

Lifetime Plus includes everything in Lifetime, plus Stenox Cloud:

- **Stenox Cloud Transcription** — No API key setup needed
- **Stenox Cloud AI Enhancement** — High-quality enhancement included
- **Zero configuration** — Just activate and start dictating

<Tip>
  **Best of both worlds:** Lifetime Plus gives you Stenox Cloud for convenience, plus the option to use local or BYOK providers whenever you want.
</Tip>

### Who Should Choose Lifetime Plus?

- You want the simplest possible experience
- You don't want to manage API keys
- You want to support Stenox development
- You want everything included with no extra setup
