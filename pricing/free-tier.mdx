**Free cloud options:**

| Provider | Free Tier |
|----------|-----------|
| **Groq Whisper** | Generous daily limits, no credit card |
| **Google Gemini** | 1,500 requests/day, no credit card |
| **DeepGram** | $200 one-time credits |

<Tip>
  **Unlimited free setup:** Use Groq Whisper (transcription) + Google Gemini (enhancement). Both have generous free tiers with no credit card required.
</Tip>

### Go 100% Local

WhisperKit and MLX have **no usage limits** — they run entirely on your Mac.

- **WhisperKit**: Unlimited transcription
- **MLX**: Unlimited AI enhancement
- **No internet required**
- **Complete privacy**
